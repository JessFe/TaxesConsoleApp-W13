# Taxes Console App
This time, I’ve created a console application using Visual Studio and C#, designed to calculate taxes due.
The application collects taxpayer information—Name, Surname, Date of Birth, Tax Code, Gender, City of Residence, and Annual Income—and applies tax brackets to the reported income to determine the amount of tax owed.

Upon completion, the program outputs a detailed summary of the taxpayer's details and the calculated tax due.
